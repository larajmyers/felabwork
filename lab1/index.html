<h1><b>People and planet are under threat</b></h1>
<p>Through the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink, we are intimately connected to nature, and in turn exposed to a cocktail of chemicals and materials. These are having a range of effects on our health.
Water, air and soil pollution can cause significant adverse health outcomes in humans, wild and domestic animals and plants. Environmental contamination is an important factor in many non-infectious diseases, including cancer and respiratory illness. Biological and chemical pollutants enhance the development and spread of antimicrobial-resistant genes in the environment. 
In addition to air pollution of the indoor or outdoor environment by chemicals, freshwater and ocean, pollution leads to the accumulation of toxic chemicals, heavy metals (such as mercury, lead and cadmium), and microplastics in the human food chain, causing adverse health outcomes in humans and domestic and wild animals.
Unintentional poisonings, mainly arising from excessive exposure to and inappropriate use of toxic chemicals, including pesticides present in occupational and/or domestic environments, are heavily affecting human health, particularly in low-income countries. 
The World Health Organization estimated that in 2012, 23% of all deaths worldwide, amounting to 12.6 million people, were due to environmental causes; with 90% occurring in low to middle income countries.</p>
